<!-- Systems for automatically creating headlines might help editors come up with catchy titles that would draw readers or visitors. However, due to the lack of adequate parallel data for low-resource languages like Bengali and the lack of ideal methods to develop a system for headline generation using pre-trained language models, particularly for lengthy news articles, the performance of headline generation systems remains challenging. In order to overcome these difficulties, we offer a sizable dataset in Bengali and use our innovative approach to enhance the headlines that are created. -->
