Welcome to my page!

My name is Abu Ubaida Akash and I prefer to be called Ubaida. I am an independent researcher, currently collaborating with [Mir Tafseer Nayeem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qoeylgEAAAAJ&hl=en "Research profile") and previously worked under the supervision of Dr. [Muhammad Ibrahim](https://du.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_details/CSE/4167 "Academic profile") and Prof. Dr. [Mohammad Shafiul Alam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=5ZXfn_cAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate "Research profile"). My research interests include, but are not limited to, Natural Language Processing, Computational Social Science, and Information Retrieval. My latest work is under review of [AACL-IJCNLP 2022](https://www.aacl2022.org/ "https://www.aacl2022.org/"). 

Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer at [Intelsense AI](https://intelsense.ai/) under the Speech and Engineering Division. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)](https://www.aust.edu/ "https://www.aust.edu/"), Dhaka, Bangladesh.
