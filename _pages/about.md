Welcome!!

My name is Abu Ubaida Akash and I prefer to be called **Ubaida**. Currently, I am appointed as a **Research Engineer** at [AIMS Lab](https://aimsl.uiu.ac.bd/#/) in United International University ([UIU](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/)) on a highly abitious project in Bangladesh, _‚ÄúAIMScribe: Automated and Intelligent Medical Scriber for Doctor-Patient Conversation‚Äù_. Apart from this, I am actively collaborating independently with [Mir Tafseer Nayeem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qoeylgEAAAAJ&hl=en "Research profile"), and previously worked under the supervision of Dr. [Muhammad Ibrahim](https://du.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_details/CSE/4167 "Academic profile") and Prof. Dr. [Mohammad Shafiul Alam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=5ZXfn_cAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate "Research profile"). My research interests include, but are not limited to, Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, Information Retrieval, and Machine Learning. One of my long papers has been accepted to appear at [EACL 2023](https://2023.eacl.org/) (main).
<!-- My recent works and ongoing projects can be found in the [Research](https://abuubaida.github.io/research/ "https://abuubaida.github.io/research/") section. -->

Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer at [Intelsense AI](https://intelsense.ai/ "https://intelsense.ai/") under the Speech and Engineering Division. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)](https://www.aust.edu/ "https://www.aust.edu/"), Dhaka, Bangladesh.
