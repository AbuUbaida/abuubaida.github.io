Thanks for stopping by!!

I‚Äôm Ubaida, though I prefer to be called Abu Ubaida. I am currently pursuing a research-based master‚Äôs in Computer Science at Universit√© de Sherbrooke, under the supervision of Dr. [Amine Trabelsi](https://amine-trabelsi.netlify.app/). My research interests include, but are not limited to, natural language processing, computational linguistics, information retrieval, and machine learning. In addition, I‚Äôve had the privilege of collaborating with Dr. [Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/) from Salesforce AI Research, United States. <span style="color:Red">Some of my recent work has been accepted for publication at both ACL and EACL.

Previously, I served as a Research Engineer at AIMS Lab, United International University ([UIU](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/)), Bangladesh, where I worked on the project ‚ÄúAIMScribe: Automated and Intelligent Medical Scriber for Doctor-Patient Conversation‚Äù.

<!-- My recent works and ongoing projects can be found in the [Research](https://abuubaida.github.io/research/ "https://abuubaida.github.io/research/") section. -->

Prior to that, I held the position of Machine Learning Research Engineer at [Intelsense AI](https://intelsense.ai/ "https://intelsense.ai/") in the Speech and Engineering Division. I earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology ([AUST](https://www.aust.edu/ "https://www.aust.edu/")), Dhaka, Bangladesh.
