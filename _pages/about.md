Welcome!!

I go by the name Abu Ubaida Akash but prefer to be called **Ubaida**. Currently, I am pursuing a research-type master's in Computer Science at Universit√© de Sherbrooke under the supervision of Dr. [Amine Trabelsi](https://amine-trabelsi.netlify.app/). My research interests include, but are not limited to, natural language processing, computational linguistics, information retrieval, and machine learning. Apart from this, I am actively collaborating with [Mir Tafseer Nayeem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qoeylgEAAAAJ&hl=en "Research profile") from the University of Alberta, Canada. <span style="color:Red">One of my long papers has been accepted to appear at [EACL 2023](https://2023.eacl.org/) (main).

Previously, I was appointed as a Research Engineer at [AIMS Lab](https://aimsl.uiu.ac.bd/#/), United International University ([UIU](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/)), Bangladesh, in the project titled _‚ÄúAIMScribe: Automated and Intelligent Medical Scriber for Doctor-Patient Conversation‚Äù_.
<!-- My recent works and ongoing projects can be found in the [Research](https://abuubaida.github.io/research/ "https://abuubaida.github.io/research/") section. -->

Before that, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at [Intelsense AI](https://intelsense.ai/ "https://intelsense.ai/") under the Speech and Engineering Division. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology ([AUST](https://www.aust.edu/ "https://www.aust.edu/")), Dhaka, Bangladesh.
